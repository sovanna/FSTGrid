## Overview

**FSTGrid**, a simple grid for my own projects and if you interested in, no problem.

I've made this grid using the original [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com) mixing with [1140 css grid](http://cssgrid.net).
I've just wanted to remove all unnecessary css style that we can find in many framework.

However, I've added two other files (base.css & layout.css) to have a default customization.
You can use it or not, just as you want.
